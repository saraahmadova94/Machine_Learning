# üìò Machine Learning Algorithm Studies

This repository is dedicated to **learning and exploring fundamental Machine Learning algorithms**. Each folder contains an individual project or notebook that dives into the logic, implementation, and application of a specific ML algorithm.

Whether you're revisiting the basics or building a strong foundation in ML, this repo aims to provide hands-on practice and insights into how these algorithms work.
